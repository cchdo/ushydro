Oceanographers spend time at sea to collect samples, and like any profession which finds itself frequently traversing the oceans, oceanographers may encounter Neptune's Court in the infamous crossing ceremony.

This ceremony consists of Pollywogs (uninitiated sailors) being inducted into the court by the Shellbacks (those having already undergone the ceremony)

The actual induction consists of having minor discomforts, like being doused in sea water or leftover food.  Today, the crossing ceremony is totally elective, and a lighthearted event meant to be fun for those involved.

In times past, the ceremony was more serious business, and all aboard were required to participate, no exceptions.  even president **** had to be inducted to the court.  This strict ceremony, which has had the same general sequence of events since the mid 1600's, most likely stems from traditions of appeasing sea spirits as well as rights of passage for new sailors to prove themselves worthy of their crews.

Other professions which may land you in a crossing ceremony include the navy and commercial sailing.
