	<p>It is necessary when sampling water, to go from surface water to far down deep in the water column. <!--THIS FIRST IMAGE WILL SHOW IN THE LIGHTBOX--> <a href="/images/gallery/styrofoam/styrofoam1.jpg" title="Shrunken styrofoam heads.

That equals 500 atmospheres! This high pressure environment creates an irrefutable excuse to shrink heads! Styrofoam mannequin heads of course, as well as styrofoam cups. The intensity of the water pressure at low depths forces the styrofoam into a more dense form, resulting in a shrunken head or cup. These objects can be drawn on with markers, creating custom 3-D shrunken mementos.  This has not yet been tried with a full size mannequin, to U.S. Hydro's knowledge...</p>
