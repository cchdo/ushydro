Want to know what it's like to go to sea with the Center's research team? This video sums it up well. The song encompasses some typical and atypical events we have experienced on our oceanographic cruises. We have truly lost communication with our equipment, lost our equipment, and lost our lunch while working with equipment. Fortunately we can usually reestablish communications, find our equipment, and eat more lunch. The images are taken from REACH and Coastal Observing Center cruises spanning several years.
