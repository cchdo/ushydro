from Jim Swift, Chief Scientist</div>
	<div id="dotted_bar"></div>

<h4>What are 57 people doing on a 273-foot research ship, heading northeastward today along the South African coast of the Indian Ocean?  Over a series of nine weekly reports from sea, I will try to provide an idea of what brought us together, what we are doing and why, what we do on the ship, what we observe, and a sense of our preliminary findings.</h4>

<p>Twenty-three of the people on board are the officers and crew of the research ship R/V Roger Revelle, which is operated by my institution, the UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and owned by the US Navy (as are all the large US university-operated ships).  The officers and crew live aboard, rotating ashore occasionally, meanwhile hosting different scientific groups who were awarded funding and ship support to carry out their research at sea.  (Such funding is a very competitive business, with only ca. 1 of 6 NSF proposals for such work meeting success.) The other 34 of us - the science party - are their current guests.  We have come together from various US institutions to very carefully measure key water properties (more about these in later installments) from the sea surface to the ocean floor on a boundary-to-boundary transect from South Africa to Australia, along approximately 32°S latitude.</p>

<p>We had long trips to meet the ship.  For example, mine involved back-to-back overnight flights, first to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to Cape Town, South Africa.  Ugh!  The drive in from the airport showed a city much different from 1996, when I last visited.  Most of the horribly ramshackle shanties were gone, replaced by housing of various sorts, mostly very plain/small apartments, but also small homes.  In the city center there were many large new buildings.</p>

<p>The ship had arrived slightly ahead of schedule after a transit from South America.   Tons of scientific equipment and lab supplies were shipped in advance from California, Washington, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and Florida, much of it in three 20-foot lab vans and two 20-foot shipping containers.  Over four days we unloaded the cargo, installed the lab vans on the ship, outfitted the ship's four main labs, and installed our deck equipment - it seems endless, but each group is experienced and got its work done.  (See the photo "Brendan_Sue_loading".) Only one item of scientific equipment never arrived: a new version of the device that measures currents from our water sampler as we lower and raise it.  We installed the older spare model, and hope it works the entire cruise.  The ship also took on tons of food - probably the most it has ever carried.</p>

<p>SIO arranged docking in the main waterfront tourist area, which was also just a short walk (by day) or cheap cab ride (at night) to the city center. (See the photo "Revelle_CapeTown".) Nights were time for dinners at some of Cape Town's excellent restaurants (how about a "mixed grill" of crocodile, kudu, springbok, and ostrich? - it was great!) and busy pubs (a Guinness for well under $3!), and the wines!</p>

<p>The Cape Town environment reminds me of San Diego's - many of our non-native plants are from this area.  I woke up at 1:30 a.m. one night smelling smoke.  Not intense as in "fire in my cabin" but still not right.  I got dressed and went to the fantail to report it to the mate on watch, but it was obvious on stepping outside that it was smoke from a brush fire.  Just like San Diego (on occasion) in late September.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon I joined a small group who took a ferry to Robben Island, where South Africa kept some of its political prisoners up through 1991.  This included a bus tour of the island, and then a guided tour of the part of the prison (and the cell) where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned.  The tour guides were former political prisoners.</p>

<p>Small things matter on a long cruise.  We determined the first day that we would have room to set up the ship's ping pong table.  Trouble was, there were only a couple balls on board and I was unable to locate any ashore.  But late one afternoon on a walk in town I noticed I was passing a beat-up looking sporting good store. Aha!  I walked out with a box of "3-stars".</p>

<p>We left port ca. 10:00 pm local time Friday, March 20th, after 6-hour delay to complete fueling (some bad fuel was found in the initial delivery that day).  This was the first time I left a port in the dark.  The southern tip of Africa is notorious for high seas and freak waves but although some choppy ship roll began as soon as we left the harbor, by morning the seas were easier.  The weather remains excellent.  The southern stars last night were wonderful, with the Magellanic Clouds easily visible.</p>

<p>So, back to the beginning of this episode #1, we are steaming northeast towards our first station, staying over the continental shelf to avoid the strong southward Agulhas Current over the shelf break.  We are in a designated northbound shipping lane from time to time, as evidenced by cargo ships and empty tankers.  We've successfully carried out our first emergency drills and our training and familiarization casts.  Everything is working well.</p>

<p>The full transect has been carried out twice before, in 1987 (36 days, 108 stations) and 2002 (46 days, 133 stations plus 13 on a different transect), and in 1995 the east and west portions were done.  We will discuss these in future installments.  But the very remote central portion of the 32°S Indian Ocean transect has not yet been measured to the same standard we have measured the other oceans.  Thus we have planned what could be the longest single cruise leg without a port stop ever done by a US university ship:  57 days and 194 stations.  I'm still a bit awed that SIO agreed to do it and that NSF and NOAA agreed to fund it.  Here we go!</p>
