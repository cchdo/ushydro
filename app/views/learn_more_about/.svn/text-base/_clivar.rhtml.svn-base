	<p style="font-style:italic;">CLIVAR: narrowing the boundaries of uncertainty</p>

	<p>In August, the National Science Foundation conducts its biannual review of grant proposals for oceanography.  Up for renewal is the Climate Variability/CO2 repeat hydrography program (CLIVAR), an ongoing survey of basic ocean properties since 1998.  It may be easy for you to miss the press release announcing this crucial effort, but climate intelligence tends to serve its role quietly as a backbone for climate science. </p>

	<p>One of the main issues of climate change right now (and a fact latched onto by skeptics) is the uncertainty involved in forecasting.  The average global temperature may rise .  These conflicting scenarios have been reported by researchers who use computer programs and existing knowledge to generate predictive models.  When faced with uncertainty, they make subjective assumptions.</p>

	<p>The uncertainties about climate change aren’t hopeless.  Researchers can identify the weak points of their models and narrow the boundaries of uncertainty by grounding their assumptions in real data.  Gathering this information requires efforts like CLIVAR which is, put simply, a fact-finding mission.  CLIVAR runs a series of cruises that survey water properties along representative tracks in the oceans every ten years.  In particular, it collects information on carbon content and unnatural chemical tracers (such as CFC’s, a common coolant outlawed in the ‘80’s), which scientists can use to identify and follow the carbon released by human activity.</p>

	<p>One example of a major uncertainty CLIVAR data can clarify:  The relative amount of oxygen in the oceans and the atmosphere has been constant, and most climate projections that account for the oceans, including those approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have assumed that it will remain so.  This has been disputed by researchers who believe warmer temperatures are already causing an outgassing of oxygen from the oceans.  The current record of oceanic oxygen provided by CLIVAR data will document the ocean-atmosphere exchange.  Eliminating uncertainty about the future is impossible, but present-day data can at least constrain models so that their projections are reasonable.</p>

	<p>Data-collecting missions such as CLIVAR represent a solid and labor-intensive step forward.  It takes $43,000/day at sea, for six weeks at a stretch, to support a team of about 25 scientists and technicians living on board and taking measurements around the clock; for now it is the only way.  There are automated technologies in development and use – remote sensing by satellite, a fleet of robots recording basic water properties by sensor – but these project don’t anticipate taking measurements at the quality or depth that climate scientists examining long-term ocean changes require.</p>

	<p>CLIVAR, a vehicle for oceanic reconnaissance, is necessary for grounding climate change projections in truth.  It is our only way of wholly monitoring the oceans’ response to climate change, and a step towards pinning down the uncertainty of what scenarios we can expect to face.  The National Science Foundation, with its merit-based review, will recognize the scientific validity of this project.  Whether they can do anything about it is another question, as they’ve suffered budget cuts from the Bush administration in favor of intelligence of a different type.</p><br /><br />
