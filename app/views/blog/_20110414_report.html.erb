<p>Not everything on a research cruise goes as
planned or hoped. We headed south last Saturday
on a dual-purpose mission. The NOAA research ship
Ronald Brown had stopped southward progress at an
iceberg corridor near 69&deg;S in 2008 when doing the
north-to-south "P18" cruise for our long-term
program. We hoped to extend their work south to
the Antarctic continental shelf break somewhere
near 100&deg;W. There was also the issue of mooring
recoveries in that same general area for LDEO
investigator Stan Jacobs. We knew from satellite
images sent to the ship that sea ice covered
nearly 100% of the surface in the area, but the
Palmer can handle sea ice if not too thick.
Still, we decided to first see how long it took
us to get to our desired end point near the shelf
break, allotting a certain maximum amount of time
to icebreaking (in accord with our master plan
for the remainder of the cruise), at which point
we would know how much time we had for our work
plus the icebreaking and steaming as we headed
back north. Admittedly success with the mooring
recoveries seemed remote because those could not
be done in full ice cover, but one never knows
until trying.</p>

<p>We reached the ice edge at the expected point
along the track and progressed well at first.
Then the going got tough, not so much because of
ice thickness as because of the large amount of
snow on the ice. Snow rubs against the ship's
hull much like sand would, sapping power and
momentum as the ship presses forward. Only about
20 miles into the ice (20 miles straight line,
but many more miles as we worked around large
snow-covered floes) the Captain and Ice Pilot
decided enough was enough. In the morning
conditions looked no better, so we took advantage
of being in a large floe to have a brief ice
party for those on board, i.e. a chance to be on
the ice a bit. We had a good time - playing
soccer, walking around, playing in the snow.
After everybody was back aboard we pulled into a
nearby opening in the ice and did a CTD cast.
That cast showed nothing remarkable compared to
nearby data from 2008. There we were, nearly 50
miles from our targets - either the shelf break
or Jacobs' moorings - but we could not go further
south. There being no point to lingering, we
headed back north to the main 67&deg;S line.</p>

<p>Thus we were not able to extend the P18 line
south through the ice to the continental shelf
break, and we were not able to recover any of
Stan Jacobs' ice-covered moorings. The only
benefit of the way this worked out was that we
spent one day's time and fuel less on the
excursion than planned so now have some weather
time in the schedule before the end of science
activities in five and a half days. This should
enable us to not only reach the eastern end of
the S04P section, but also to sample its eastern
boundary region appropriately.</p>

<p>We always enjoy our trips through the ice. We did
not see many penguins this time (though there
were a few, including Emperor penguins) but there
were many seals hauled out onto the thicker
floes. The leads (openings in the ice) are
freezing over and there are many 4 to 10-foot
holes punched up through the thin ice. The
culprits? Orcas (Killer Whales) on the lookout
for seals on the thicker ice nearby. Jim saw a
pair of them stick their heads out of one of the
holes to take a look-see.</p>

<p>The weather has been unusually good. That may
well change, but we are back on "the line" and
for now we are mowing down the final stations one
by one, making very good progress. Everyone has
their sights set on keeping steady and focused:
Get the job done. Then go to port!</p>

<p>All is well on the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
