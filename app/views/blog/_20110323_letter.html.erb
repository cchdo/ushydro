	<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p>

	<p>We've had a different sort of week than just one CTD station after another.
	First we enjoyed a thrilling transit through all sorts of ice, dodging
	zones where heavy ice would significantly slow us down, with a gorgeous
	sunset and moonrise.  Then it was time to recover two vertical arrays of
	bottom-anchored instruments co-chief scientist Alex Orsi deployed during
	February 2010.</p>

	<p>Each instrument cable was anchored to a heavy weight on the bottom, with
	subsurface floats pulling the cable taut, instruments were attached to the
	cable, and an "acoustic release" connects the cable to the anchor weight.
	In the following paragraph note that to recover a mooring you must first
	find it (none of it is at the surface while it is deployed), and you must
	be able to communicate with the release device (done with coded acoustic
	signals). If those are both successful (by no means guaranteed), you need
	daylight and reasonably good weather to recover it, which means in
	statistical terms less than 50% of the time on this cruise. Of course, the
	long line of instruments will hopefully rise to the sea surface after the
	acoustic release has been told to let go from the anchor, and you have to
	be able to see it - not as easy as you might think.  And on top of that,
	you need to be careful when you grab it and haul it in.</p>

	<p>When we reached the first of the mooring sites, Alex and Woods Hole mooring
	expert Jim Ryder (we are most fortunate to have him on board with us for
	our mooring work) went right to work. Thanks to GPS, they knew where the
	first string of instruments was supposed to be. The Captain brought the
	Palmer near that point and they tried to communicate with the mooring's
	release devices, but received only a weak, partial answer. After working
	the ship through a search pattern, stopping every now and then to try
	again, they learned that the releases were more than a mile away from where
	they had been set down - perhaps an iceberg dragged the mooring sometime
	during the year. Trouble was, it was now too dark to try to recover the
	mooring. So we did a short line of CTD stations overnight. In the morning
	the weather was too iffy for a mooring recovery, so we headed over to the
	second mooring, about 32 miles away, to try to verify its location. By then
	the weather was seriously deteriorating and so we were able to do no more
	than learn that it, too, had been dragged, more than two miles. Further
	work was impossible and so we headed into the ice pack to wait out an
	impressively ugly storm. With blocks of ice being tossed about the sea
	surface in 60-knot winds, thank goodness we were safe on a sturdy
	icebreaker! When conditions improved, we headed to the first mooring site
	(the closest), where Jim and his team from the ship (our marine techs and
	the graduate students) recovered the mooring with few problems. Then we
	returned to the second mooring site, and in growing darkness its releases
	were acoustically triggered, and, voila, there was its blinking light
	beacon! The recovery was trouble free and Alex got back every instrument he
	deployed.</p>

	<p>Oceanographers reading this may be interested to note that during our lines
	of CTD stations at each mooring site we saw water at several hundred meters
	depth that was colder than the freezing point at the sea surface. This can
	take place when cold water circulates and is cooled under floating, very
	deep reaching Antarctic ice shelves. This was the first time I had observed
	such water myself.</p>

	<p>We then had a long steam to the start of our next line of CTD stations.
	Alex brought along several cases of eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs),
	small disposable instruments which provide a temperature profile from a
	moving ship. The students and a couple of other helpers dropped XBTs every
	30 minutes over the day and a half transit.</p>

	<p>My chief responsibilities with respect to a research cruise have to do with
	(a) preparing a cruise plan ahead of the cruise, (b) seeing that an
	appropriate team with its equipment is put in place to carry out the plan,
	(c) monitoring progress at sea, and then (d) modifying the plan as or if
	needed. With respect to (a), I am guided by world class experts such as
	Alex Orsi, Kevin Speer (at Florida State University), Stan Jacobs (at
	Columbia University), and the members of the science oversight committee
	for the US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography program - plus many
	others - so that goes well. Item (b) is easy with this team: I am honored
	to be able to work with these technical specialists, with the expert
	captain, mariners, engineers, and support staff Edison Chouest Offshore
	provides on the Nathaniel B. Palmer, and our experienced group from
	Raytheon Polar Services. Item (c) sort of takes care of itself since we
	keep records of, well, everything. Then there is (d). I remind myself that
	"if it was a good plan ashore it is still a good plan at sea". But what do
	I do when, by my accounting, we have already lost 7 full days due to bad
	weather? Yet, some other aspects - the station work and time slowed down in
	ice in particular - have gone remarkably well in our favor. I listen to
	good advice, and make a decision.</p>

	<p>The cruise to date included work of such high scientific priority that I
	felt compelled to complete it as planned, without reduction, waiting out
	weather. But now as we begin the second half of this long cruise, I have
	decided to allot specific amounts of time to each remaining segment of the
	cruise except for a few "must complete, no matter what" activities. This is
	one way to get around the unknowns. The Captain is happy to work in a
	somewhat similar manner: within proper maritime limits he can allocate fuel
	in a cruise-segment manner roughly similar to my allocation of time. (The
	ship uses far more fuel breaking ice than traversing open water, and also
	burns significantly more going, say 11 knots than 9 knots in open water.)
	Both of us plan when and where we will apply our resources and where we
	will hold reserves.</p>

	<p>I have thus determined that we will have a go at a south-to-north line of
	stations along 170&deg;W I had been prepared to cut just days ago. I allocated
	sufficient time to do it, and we will complete as much of it as the weather
	permits. Then we will move on to the next segment. But no rushing, no
	change in the way we work. I'll let you know how this goes!</p>

	<p>All is well on the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
