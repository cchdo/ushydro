<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p>

</p>

<p>One of the inescapable aspects of working in the Southern Ocean is storms -
both the ones that hit directly and the more distant ones that generate the
long, rolling waves known as swell. The Southern Ocean may be the stormiest
large-scale environment on earth - I don't know that for certain but it
feels that way. Big low pressure systems (storms) develop and evolve to
circulate around Antarctica in a steady parade. Our mote in the ocean - the
Nathaniel B. Palmer - has been hit three times so far by storms with winds
well over 40 knots (equals 46 statute miles/hour), plus the ship is always
affected by swell (sometimes quite large) propagating from distant storms.
We can work in wind and swell to a degree, but we have already had more
than 77 hours of down time when the seas were too rough to work.</p>

<p>As part of our cruise support, we receive weather forecasts customized to
our location. In the old days such forecasts were next to worthless, but
with the advent of weather satellites and computer models, we get a day or
two warning of each storm. So what do we think when we hear a storm is
forecast to affect us soon?  Well, officially it's "get as much work done
as we can and get everything tied down", but unofficially it's also "get to
the laundry before the storm hits", because the laundry machines must be
shut down during storms in order to avoid damage to them caused by ship
motion.</p>

<p>The Palmer rides the storms well. The captain and his officers choose a
heading and slow speed that will provide a reasonably good ride, and try to
judge when to head back to the next station just in time for the seas to
have improved post-storm to the point where we can go back to work. We have
work to do, but the pace definitely slows with no new samples to analyze.
Some people suffer more than others from seasickness, though the fortunate
majority of us have now adapted to the ship's motion in stormy seas.</p>

<p>The biggest storm, with a long spell of sustained winds over 50 knots,
caused some damage: a storage van on the fantail was partly caved in by a
wave. A photo frame from the ship's stern video camera shows a large wave
breaking over the fantail. You can see why we do not go out on deck in
heavy seas or storms!</p>

<p>I have been asked, "how much 'bad weather time' did you allow when you
planned the cruise?" The answer may surprise you: none. With the cost to
taxpayers of a research cruise like this running in the $100,000/day range,
one cannot justify extra funds for contingency expenses. And, anyway, this
cruise is already near the Palmer's maximum duration at sea (mostly
determined by fuel) for our type of work. What I do have is a maximum
science plan that will accomplish all objectives within the allotted time,
and the responsibility to make the best cuts to it (if needed) at the best
times so that we accomplish our highest priorities while still ending up at
the last planned station shortly before the time, barring emergencies, that
we must head to port.</p>

<p>The other day, while we were waiting out a storm, I noticed we were
entering a field of rotten first-year sea ice leftover from the summer
melt. Aha! I asked the gang to prepare the rosette and alerted the deck
tech and bridge: I knew that in the ice the large seas would be damped down
and we could do our station. The mate on watch kept us in a small patch of
open water in the midst of the ice field, and everything worked out great.
Meanwhile we passed by some crabeater and leopard seals hauled out onto the
ice (photos attached). [Quick, how can you tell, when you see a seal on the
ice, if you are in the Antarctic or, instead, the Arctic?  If you can come
right up close to the seal, you are in the Antarctic, and if the seal dives
in the water at first sight of you, you are in the Arctic. The difference:
polar bears (an Arctic-only predator).]</p>

<p>We already have some exciting science results: significant changes since
1992 in seawater temperature and salinity along our transect of stations NE
from Cape Adare. We'll soon send early results to the science team ashore
to whet their appetites.</p>

<p>The food is great (some of us already fear we may be getting great
ourselves), and all hands (ECO, RPSC, and science guests alike) enjoy the
friendly and productive atmosphere on board. We may get a tiny bit
frustrated during the storms - we came here to work, after all - but we are
a happy bunch.</p>

<p>All is well aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
