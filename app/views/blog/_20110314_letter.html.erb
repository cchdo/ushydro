<p>Dear Program Managers, Colleagues, Friends, and Family,</p>

<p>We recently lost contact with the INMARSAT satellite the Nathaniel B.
Palmer uses for email.  My understanding is that this is related to the
ship's position relative to the "footprint" of the satellite's coverage.
Although email may be temporarily regained, perhaps in limited capacity for
short messages such as this, it is feasible that we will not return to full
email capability for approximately one week.</p>

<p>Emails sent to the ship are supposed to remain queued in the USA until full
email service is regained, and are supposed to be sent then without loss.</p>

<p>I will prepare weekly letters and reports as usual, but will not email them
until told by RPSC that our regular email service is back in action.
Please excuse any delay in hearing from me and others on board.  All is
well here, and we are making good progress in good weather.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Jim Swift<br>
Chief Scientist<br>
Nathaniel B. Palmer Cruise NBP-1102 (S04P)<br>
