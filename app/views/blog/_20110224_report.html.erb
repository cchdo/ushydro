<p>Our cruise for the NSF and NOAA-sponsored US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat
Hydrography Program will cross the far-south Pacific sector of the
Antarctic region on the US Antarctic Program (USAP) icebreaking research
ship Nathaniel B. Palmer. We are scheduled for a 60-70 day voyage from the
USAP McMurdo base to Punta Arenas, Chile. This cruise is unique for the
program in that it is being carried out from a USAP ship operated by a
commercial operator, Edison-Chouest Offshore (ECO) (under charter to the US
National Science Foundation), with pre-cruise planning, shipping,
logistics, and on-board science support from a second company, Raytheon
Polar Services Corporation (RPSC) (via contract with the US National
Science Foundation).</p>

<p>Our science team assembled in Christchurch, New Zealand, where we attended
a pre-ice-flight briefing and cold weather clothing issue, and on 14
February flew to the ice sheet runway near Ross Island via a US Air Force
C-17 transport. Although cancelled flights and "boomerangs" (flights turned
back by weather or equipment problems) are frequent, our flight went
without incident. The science team was excited to be in Antarctica and had
two days to enjoy the unique amenities, scenery, and recreational
opportunities at the base, including a guided tour to Robert F. Scott's
1902 "Discovery Hut" at Hut Point on Ross Island.</p>

<p>We soon discovered that much of the S04P "do not freeze" cargo was for
reasons not yet explained sitting outdoors in sub-freezing conditions at
McMurdo, despite our use of the proper procedures, forms, and labels
required for "do not freeze" cargo items. In the end the chief scientific
damage was to the Argo float program, which was cancelled with all 17
floats shipped back to the USA. By what appears to be a blind stroke of
good fortune, the one "do not freeze" cargo container which had been kept
above freezing contained the salinity and carbon seawater standards - with
the loss of either the expedition would have been cancelled. Some other
cargo had been water damaged at some point during transit, then was damaged
by mold, then frozen, but the direct losses to the science programs from
that damage were minimal.</p>

<p>The science team boarded the ship midday on 17 February and soon set to
unloading scientific cargo from the 5 20-foot container vans and setting up
the CO2 lab van (a trace metal lab van was already at the ship from the
previous leg). All RPSC staff on the ship (staff from the previous cruise
plus staff from the S04P cruise) plus all ECO personnel were friendly and
extremely helpful. Lab set-ups went very well, again with RPSC and ECO
personnel efficiently providing assistance. Because the ship was refueled
upon its arrival, cargo loading and lab set-ups were delayed, making it
necessary to delay the ship's departure one day from the plan.</p>

<p>RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer departed McMurdo Base at noon local time on 20
February 2011 in good weather, into McMurdo region waters nearly free of
sea ice. The planned transit to the first station on the S04P line was
estimated to be approximately two days, barring stops. On the 21st the
science team held two test/training rosette casts with the large 36-place
rosette. Only minor problems were encountered, all fixed in short order.
The evening of the 21st the trace metal team carried out a trace metal cast
of opportunity, making up a station from the previous cruise lost to
weather.</p>

<p>During the 22nd, as the ship neared the location of the first S04P station
off Cape Adare, winds rose well past 30 knots, then 40 knots. It was thus
necessary to wait until 1000 local time on 23 February to begin the S04P
transect stations.</p>

<p>After nearly two weeks of travel from the US, cruise preparation at
McMurdo, and transit to the northwestern Ross Sea, it was a joy to begin
work. Weather conditions have been good, and we have almost completed the
portion of our transect across the Ross Sea deep outflow with virtually no
problems ... an outstanding beginning.</p>

<p>Food on board is excellent, relationships between all on board friendly and
productive, the ship itself lovingly-maintained for productive research and
pleasant life on board.</p>

<p>Some of our colleagues and hundreds of RPSC personnel being flown out of
McMurdo (as it switches from 1000-person summer staffing to a 200-person
winter complement) were caught in Christchurch by the latest earthquake. We
have heard that the people we worked with on board are safe, though many
were separated from their belongings, passports, and so forth, and face
many difficulties along with those endured by the residents of that lovely
small city. Our thoughts are truly with them.</p>
