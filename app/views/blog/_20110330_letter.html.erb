	<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p>

	<p>Our decision to do a somewhat-shortened version of the 170&deg;W section
	worked out fine.  (I'll attach a <a href="/reports/weekly_reports/NBP1102_progress_to_30MAR.pdf">map</a> to show you where we have sampled so
	far.)  The weather was great, we got the 8th (final) station done 6 hours
	before deadline, and the data showed the features we hoped to measure. We
	then began a planned 50-hour steam to our next station. Half-way through we
	had to slow down due to the rough ride in moderately heavy weather. The
	slow-down used all the hours we had gained and then some, but we are back
	to work in light winds, easier seas, and fog.</p>

	<p>At our last station on the 170&deg;W line a group of humpback whales swam
	around us - close by - for a couple of hours. Although we have no way to
	know, they seemed to be enjoying themselves, swimming by in different
	positions, flapping fins on the water, making grunting sounds, etc. Just
	listening to their deep breathing was a treat.</p>

	<p>Some of you have asked for more about life on board. Juan Botella's blog
	covers some of this. Juan is a high school science teacher from Wisconsin
	who is participating on our cruise as part of the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC
	program. You will see that Juan is gifted at describing what we do and he
	is also an excellent photographer. Please see
	<a href="http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/seawater-property-changes-in-the-southern-ocean">http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/seawater-property-changes-in-the-southern-ocean</a>.</p>

	<p>The Palmer is 303 feet long and 60 feet wide. We work and eat on the main
	deck level, which includes the outside working decks, the "Baltic room"
	from which we deploy most of our instruments, 6 principal laboratories,
	marine tech shops, the galley, the mess room, and some of the food storage
	areas. The staterooms for most of the science and Raytheon team are on the
	"01", i.e. one deck above. The machinery spaces, shops, storage, and tanks
	are below the main deck, and most of that territory is off-limits for good
	reason. Although there are other, successively smaller decks above - the
	bridge ("05") being the top - each of us spends most of each day in a
	relatively small portion of the ship. Most of us work 12-hour shifts.
	That's a long time "on", but the work is usually not too intense and we
	like having 12 hours "off". Meals are served cafeteria style at 0730-0830,
	1130-1230, 1730-1830, and 2330-0030, plus there is always food available at
	other times such as coffee, tea, soda, milk, juices, fruit, cereal, bread,
	sandwich fixings, crackers, and a host of fresh-baked goodies - and more.
	There is fresh-baked bread almost every day, and, this being a Louisiana
	ship, there are beans and rice available at every meal. Breakfast is pretty
	much your traditional breakfast choices. At lunch and dinner (each has a
	different menu) there are typically 2-3 entr√©e choices, one or two
	starches, a soup (the same for both meals), and one or two vegetables.  At
	mid-rats (what the 2330-0030 meal is traditionally called) there are
	breakfast items, some leftovers from earlier meals, and often a special
	item or two, such as fresh bagels, or pizza, or, well, almost anything.
	Meal time is a social time, and enjoyed by all. In our time off we do our
	laundry (there is a self-serve laundry on each level where there are
	berths), use the gym, enjoy time on the bridge, read, watch movies, play
	cards, practice a musical instrument, etc. - and sleep of course. Most
	people have roommates and the work schedule and roommate assignments were
	coordinated where feasible so that people on opposite shifts room together.
	Every day is pretty much like every other day except for weather and food.
	We have talks - science or slide shows of trips - on Wednesday evenings and
	Saturday after lunch. These are open to everyone. We spend no time on the
	internet because we have no internet here, but everyone looks forward to
	email. There is a conference room on the "03" level and a movie theater
	(like a large home theater) with comfy recliner chairs on the "02" level.
	There are DVDs you can borrow to play on your computer, too. Each stateroom
	has its own head (bathroom) with sink, toilet, and shower. We are
	responsible for all our own cleaning. The crew does an amazing job keeping
	the public areas of the ship clean - this is one of the cleanest, best
	maintained research ships in the world - and we try to help out by keeping
	our cabins, and especially the labs, in good order. The crew is always very
	friendly and helpful. It's a relaxed, pleasant environment, though in work
	terms never a sloppy one due to our universal attention to safety and to
	maintaining very high measurement and procedure standards.</p>

	</p><p>There are a few group activities such as a themed movie time. Presently we
	are being "killed" one by one: a tag game called "murder", popular on
	research ships, is in final stages. You are "killed" by the murderer
	accosting you in private with the Queen of Spades. If you correctly
	challenge the secret "murderer" before you are a victim, you become the new
	"murderer", but if you are wrong, you are "dead". Meanwhile the cribbage
	tournament is into round two. And there are plans afoot for a couple of
	other group events or activities. Little things, but it keeps life moving
	along.</p>

	<p>All is well on the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
