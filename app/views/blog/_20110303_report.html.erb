<p>We began our work off Cape Adare, a location notorious for high winds.
Indeed, seas and swell have already disrupted CTD operations on Nathaniel
B. Palmer four times, with 84 hours lost to date (the equivalent of 18
stations). The Palmer rides the storms well. The captain and mates choose
a heading and slow speed that will provide a reasonably good ride, and try
to judge when to head back to the next station just in time for the seas to
have improved post-storm to the point where we can go back to work. During
the biggest storm, during a long spell of sustained winds over 50 knots, a
storage van on the fantail was partly caved in by a wave.</p>

<p>At one point while we were waiting out a storm near an intended station
location, we entered a field of rotten first-year sea ice leftover from the
summer melt. We quickly prepared the rosette, knowing that in the ice the
large seas would be damped down, and, indeed, we got a station done despite
the weather. Meanwhile we passed by some crabeater and leopard seals hauled
out onto the ice, making a nice photo op.</p>

<p>It's not all been storms, of course. The team is working diligently and
every measurement program is going well. Water sample data are being
delivered to the onboard data system by all the groups, and the data
processors update the data files regularly. We already have some exciting
science results: significant changes since 1992 in seawater temperature and
salinity along our transect of stations NE from Cape Adare. The cold, salty
Ross Sea Bottom Water dense outflow so prominent in 1992 on the west end of
the S04P section is now gone, and the Circumpolar Deep Water offshore is
warmer and saltier than it was 19 years ago. We've included a
<a href="/public/etc/S04P_report_02_02Mar2011_figure.pdf">figure and
Alex's scientific caption</a> to whet the appetites of the PIs ashore.</p>

<p>The food is great (some of us already fear we may be getting great
ourselves).  All hands - ECO, RPSC, and science guests alike - enjoy the
friendly and productive atmosphere on board. The ECO engineers and RPSC
staff have been very helpful in quickly solving any problems that arise. We
may get a tiny bit frustrated during the storms - we came here to work,
after all - but we are a happy bunch.</p>

<p>All is well.</p>

<p>Jim and Alex</p>
