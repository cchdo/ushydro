	<p>We have increased our basic CTD station spacing
	to 60 nautical miles, from the original 30
	nautical miles. We kept to 30 over the core (and
	highest priority) part of the cruise plan. We
	knew, however, that when we crossed into the
	Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which we are now
	sailing in and along, there was little
	oceanographic damage switching to 60-mile
	spacing, which helps save time. The station plan
	includes runs to the continental slope with more
	closely spaced stations at the ends of the P18
	and S4P lines. Ice conditions at the end of the
	P18 line (see <a href="/reports/weekly_reports/06APR_ice_map_with_P18_approach.pdf">attached file</a> for today's ice map)
	may allow us to make it to the shelf break,
	perhaps a little east of the intended line,
	within the time we will allot to that portion of
	the cruise plan.</p>

	<p>The pace in the labs is now a little more
	relaxed.  With a plan in place regarding how we
	intend to complete the measurement program
	(within the next two weeks), everyone is focused
	on simply getting the job done.</p>

	<p>Temperature and salinity differences with the
	1992 Ioffe occupation of S04P continue in a
	similar vein to those reported earlier: away from
	the western boundary, the bulk of the water
	column is a little warmer and possibly slightly
	saltier now than measured in 1992.</p>

	<p>A major activity this week was the deployment of
	a 4 km string of moored instruments at a
	specified spot in the ocean for Xiaojun Yuan
	(Columbia/LDEO) and Janet Sprintall (SIO).
	Neither PI was on board, but because WHOI mooring
	expert Jim Ryder was along, they knew - quite
	correctly - that their project was in great
	hands. The specifications called for the top
	float of the mooring to be 100 meters below the
	sea surface - in ca. 4500 meters of water - plus
	the mooring needed to be in an area where the
	bottom was flat, and had to be deployed in
	reasonably good weather. We used the Palmer's
	multi-beam bathymetric mapping system (managed by
	Chris Linden, RPSC) to map the ocean floor, then
	we did a CTD cast at the most likely looking
	mooring deployment spot to measure the water
	characteristics and verify the bottom depth.
	There were also a host of XBT casts and one more
	CTD cast associated with the mooring science
	program, not to mention the long deployment
	itself. Add a day of time lost to bad weather
	before mooring deployment, and you can see why
	this was quite an operation, and one we are glad
	to have completed successfully and now have
	behind us.</p>

	<p>A highlight for the science team was tours of the
	Palmer's engine spaces this week by Chief
	Engineer Johnny Pierce ("JP") and his expert team
	of engineers. With two of the four large marine
	diesel engines powered up plus some of the
	electrical generator diesels, of course hearing
	protection was needed, and there are
	hot/dangerous spots to avoid. But ordinary
	clothes are fine - nothing will get dirty during
	a tour to the engineers' nearly spotless work
	place, as clean and as orderly as can be. Wow!</p>

	<p>Holidays can be fun on board, so April 1st got
	some special attention. Even better, some of us
	who were "fooled" forgot that it was April 1st,
	adding to the joy of the conspirators and the fun
	had by all. Check out Juan's blog for the fun.</p>

	<p>We're a relaxed bunch, well-fed, tired of stormy
	weather, happy for the present good weather, and
	working together to get the job done.</p>

	<p>All is well on the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>

	<p>"<a href="/reports/weekly_reports/06APR_ice_map_with_P18_approach.pdf">06APR_ice_map_with_P18_approach</a>" shows the
	planned P18S track to (and slightly beyond) the
	shelf break along with the 06April2011 ice
	conditions. If conditions stay much the same, our
	"P18S" track would run slightly east of that
	shown, in more favorable ice conditions. Ice
	coverage is currently ca. 100% in the area of
	Stan Jacobs' moorings. We are not equipped to
	recover moorings in ice-covered waters.</p>
