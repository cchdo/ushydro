	<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p> 
 
	<p>What is remarkable about most of the past week may be how unremarkable it
	was: after a long storm (our 4th!) which stopped our work last Thursday
	morning finally abated in the wee hours Saturday, we have been working
	steadily on our measurement program, just as we usually do and expect to do
	on these cruises. We are making fine progress, though are about 4.5 days
	behind the expedition deadline timeline. Small problems pop up in the
	equipment from time to time, and we have found some ways to improve a few
	procedures - pretty much business as usual. (I'll get into our science
	program in future letters.) The sameness of the work - we are either on
	station or steaming between stations around the clock - is an oddly
	comforting measure of progress. Of course, we very much enjoy the little
	breaks nature provides...</p> 
 
	  <p>Icebergs are a reliable scenic highlight of working
	  near Antarctica, and when we chance upon one on a
	  sunny moment (one of my <a name="name1"></a><a href="#photo1">photos</a> is attached) or at 
	  sunrise or sunset (attached unenhanced <a name="name2"></a><a href="#photo2">sunset photo</a> 
	  taken by Aimee Neeley), it's time to bring out
	  the cameras.</p> 
 
	  <p>Along with some clear periods during days has come
	  some clear periods at night, and we have seen the
	  Aurora Australis ("Southern Lights") a few times.
	  Our PolarTREC teacher, Juan Botella, captured some
	  excellent <a name="name3"></a><a href="#photo3">night photos</a> from a moving ship (!). I 
	  have attached two, enhanced for light level only.
	  Notice the stars of Orion's belt in one of them?</p> 
 
	  <p>A few humpback whales visited the ship the other day,
	  playing around (or feeding?) a bit before swimming off.
	  Juan captured some nice photos (<a name="name4"></a><a href="#photo4">one is attached</a>).</p> 
 
	<p>Nature is not the only source of welcome breaks: the galley staff is great
	at keeping morale (and waistlines) at a maximum. Fresh bagels made a
	surprise appearance, the cookie supply seems endless, the meal entrees are
	as tasty and varied as ever (with some excellent vegetarian dishes, too) -
	and I don't know what it was about Mexican night, but just about everyone
	went back for seconds. Of course, because the ship was resupplied in that
	garden spot known as McMurdo, no one is surprised that the fresh vegetable
	supply is dwindling - lettuce is gone now, as expected.</p> 
 
	<p>This is a harmonious, very good natured bunch. Cribbage and foosball
	tournaments are in full swing, groups linger at meals to enjoy
	conversations, music is heard from time to time. All is well aboard the
	Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
