	<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p> 
 
	<p>Greetings from Antarctica! Our team traveled from our homes first to
	Christchurch, New Zealand, where we assembled and enjoyed the sunny
	weather and green gardens before our trip south. We had been told ahead to
	pack a "boomerang bag" which we would take with us if our flight to
	Antarctica was turned back en route by fast-changing Antarctic weather,
	because we would not get all our luggage back until we finally made it to
	Antarctica.  (We found out that the record for consecutive boomerangs was
	seven!)  We had also been told that certain items were required in our
	carry on bags, which had to fit under our seats. We thought these were one
	in the same so were quite relieved to be told during the pre-flight
	briefing the day before our flight that the boomerang bag was just one of
	our checked bags.</p> 
 
	<p>Our 5-hour flight from Christchurch to McMurdo was on a US Air Force C-17
	transport.  The flight was smooth (and noisy - we wore ear plugs), and the
	bag lunch they gave us enough for two. We got to take turns going into the
	cockpit to take photos of Antarctica from the aircraft. The landing was
	super-smooth and then, Wow!, we stepped out and found ourselves on this
	giant ice sheet in Antarctica, with a smoking Mt. Erebus in the
	background! The US Antarctic Program (USAP) staff took us in large polar
	transporters across the ice sheet and then around roads to the McMurdo
	base. On the way we saw penguins, seals, the New Zealand base, and more
	great bleak Antarctic scenery. We had a quick orientation briefing, were
	issued room keys and linens, told where to get food and our luggage, and
	given a schedule for a few events we'd want to attend.</p> 
 
	<p>The large USAP McMurdo base resembles a clean, well-run polar mining town
	with about 1000 residents. There are no commercial activities, but
	otherwise it has just about everything you'd expect: dorms, a cafeteria
	(serving a variety of hearty food), a small store, post office, coffee
	house, bar, labs, gyms, support buildings ad infinitum, lots of heavy
	equipment, warehouses, fuel tanks, etc. Impressive attention is paid to
	waste management, recycling, and environmental stewardship, making it one
	of the cleanest towns on earth. There is a port - open only a very short
	time each year, and that only after break-in by a heavy icebreaker - with
	a man-made pier made of reinforced ice.  There are hiking trails and
	historic sites. We had a guided tour to Robert Scott's "Discovery Hut"
	from 1902, close by the base (see
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Hut">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Hut</a>). While anyone can walk there,
	because we had a guide we were allowed inside, seven at a time. In the
	"freeze-dried" environment of Antarctica, everything down to animal
	carcasses awaiting skinning and boxes of supplies was just as it was, and
	is being left that way for the future.</p> 
 
	<p>Speaking of "freeze-dried", that's how we felt after walking back from the
	hut to the base into a stiff and very cold wind - evening air temperature
	had dropped to 5 degF - the term "wind chill" (in that case well below
	-20) was certainly appropriate! (In Christchurch the USAP issued us cold
	weather clothing, and we were glad we had it.)  But for the most part
	temperatures have been in the teens, and today's 23 degF and light winds
	make it feel almost balmy.</p> 
 
	<p>Our ship, the research icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer, arrived yesterday
	morning and fueling began immediately. (The McMurdo base reverts to its
	200-person winter status this weekend and the fueling crew needed to get
	done so they could head home.) The departing science party will be off the
	ship this morning, and we board and begin loading right after lunch today.</p> 
 
	<p>There have been many little hiccups along the way, and one giant one: Much
	of our "do not freeze" cargo was inexplicably left sitting out in
	sub-freezing conditions, despite being correctly and unmistakably labeled
	as "Do Not Freeze". (There are procedures for this, beginning with a cargo
	plan before we even ship the items from our labs, and every group affected
	by this incredible blunder had followed instructions perfectly.) Even the
	ship's "do not freeze" food was sitting out in the cold. One container of
	our DNF cargo was correctly kept above freezing, and by some miracle that
	contained the standards for salinity and carbon, without which we would
	have had to cancel the expedition. But the Argo floats - worth $500,000 -
	were not so lucky, and must be shipped back, unused. (They would have
	provided the first winter CTD casts from much of this region.) We will not
	know the extent of damage to our other programs until we begin
	measurements, but we are hopeful that we can work around most problems.</p> 
 
	<p>We have a very good team for this cruise. I enjoy the way everyone gets
	along together and can tell already we will work together well as one
	team. I met the Captain last night, and was impressed in every respect.
	Our on-board Raytheon Polar Services Corporation support staff are a good
	bunch. So prospects are good for our upcoming voyage. Last night we all
	unwound in the bar, and in a few hours we begin loading. I'll report again
	when we leave port.</p> 
 
	<p>Best Regards,<br /> 
	Jim Swift</p> 
 
	<p>PS - Because I do not go onto the ship's very limited email
	(james.swift.guest@nbp.usap.gov) until tomorrow, I can send lots of photos
	today from the McMurdo base internet:</p>
