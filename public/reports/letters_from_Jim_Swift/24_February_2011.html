	<p>Dear Family, Friends, and Colleagues,</p> 
 
	<p>RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer departed McMurdo Base Sunday noon, one day later
	than originally planned.  (Instead of handling the cargo when the ship came
	in, it was fueled first - normally we can set-up the labs during fueling
	but of course our gear was not yet on board.) The area near McMurdo was
	unusually free of sea ice. I saw a couple of penguins waving goodbye to us
	(photo attached) and we enjoyed the bleak yet spectacular Antarctic scenery
	(example photos attached). There were a few whale tails or fins sighted
	from time to time, but nothing dramatic.</p> 
 
	<p>As first I was busy non-stop, although in another sense I do very little,
	because I mostly see that things get done, that person A gets together with
	person B, and so forth, and others do most of the work. We had no major
	problems but the techs were busy with the many details that all need to
	come together. The RPSC techs on the ship were very helpful.</p> 
 
	<p>On the 21st the science team held two test/training rosette casts with the
	large 36-place rosette. Only minor problems were encountered, all fixed in
	short order. The evening of the 21st the trace metal team carried out a
	trace metal cast, making up a station from the previous cruise lost to
	weather. So after two and a half days of transit and these casts, we were
	then ready to go, but during the 22nd, as the ship neared the location of
	the first S04P station off Cape Adare, winds rose well past 30 knots, then
	well past 40 knots. It was thus necessary to wait until 1000 local time on
	23 February to begin the S04P transect stations.</p> 
 
	<p>After nearly two weeks of travel from the US, cruise preparation at
	McMurdo, transit to the northwestern Ross Sea, and waiting out the storm,
	it was a joy to finally begin work. Everybody, all the equipment, and the
	ship are working great, plus the weather has been good so far (though
	forecast to seriously deteriorate tomorrow). We have almost completed the
	portion of our transect across the Ross Sea deep outflow with virtually no
	problems ... an outstanding beginning.</p> 
 
	<p>The food on the Palmer has been excellent. I have been eating lots of
	vegetables, knowing the "freshies" will not last long. The ship has a baker
	and it is very hard to resist the continual flow of fresh treats. The
	freshly-baked rolls at lunch and dinner are irresistible. In self defense I
	have used the ship's modest gym every day at sea so far. Their aerobic
	machines are updated since 2003 (the ones in 2003 were the same as in 1996
	so I was wondering about that) and OK. There is adequate equipment for
	resistance training, but I am still getting used to it. I have practiced
	the bassoon regularly, too. Relationships between all on board are friendly
	and productive, the ship itself lovingly-maintained for productive research
	and pleasant life on board.</p> 
 
	<p>Some of our colleagues and hundreds of RPSC personnel being flown out of
	McMurdo (as it switches from 1000-person summer staffing to a 200-person
	winter complement) were caught in Christchurch by the latest earthquake. We
	have heard that the people we worked with on board are safe, though many
	were separated from their belongings, passports, and so forth, and face
	many difficulties along with those endured by the residents of that lovely
	small city. Our thoughts are truly with them.</p> 
 
	<p>We received an email last night from Kevin Cahill (WHOI), the helium set-up
	tech, who was unhurt but lost his luggage in the earthquake, which included
	this about Rick Rupan, the Argo float set-up tech who had to send all his
	PI's floats back to Seattle due to being frozen: "It turns out that Rick is
	a volunteer back in Seattle with the Red Cross Disaster Relief team. His
	job is to run a shelter in case of emergency and that's what he did last
	night. It was pretty impressive, Rick and Aaron did an amazing job. He got
	everyone's name, set up the elderly and young women and family's with beds
	in the neighbor's houses. They kept a lot of anxious people calm, warm and
	safe. ... It turns out Rick wasn't here for the floats, he was here to help
	out in the quake."</p> 
 
	<p>I am sleeping well, eating too well, and doing well. I would have said that
	I have done this work frequently enough now that I am nearing Jedi Master
	stage, but during our second test cast I temporarily forgot that the
	display the winch operator was working from had a 40+ meter error [now
	corrected] and _almost_ forgot to tell the winch operator to slow down as
	he was bringing our multi-hundred-thousand dollar instrument package near
	the surface. Everything worked out OK, but the error reminded me to think,
	think, think.</p> 
 
	<p>All is well aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer.</p>
